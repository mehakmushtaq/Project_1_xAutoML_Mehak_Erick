# Project_1_xAutoML_Mehak_Erick
This project is based on the following steps:
**First step:**
Choose a dataset. Build and train a baseline for comparison. To construct the
baseline you do the following
â€¢ Try a set of possible machine learning algorithms (13 algorithms) using their
default hyperparamters and choose the one with the highest performance
for comparison.
**Second step:**
Based on the problem at hand, we study the potential pipeline structure,
algorithms or feature transformers at each step, hyper-parameters ranges. Use
hyperOpt with the potential search space to beat the baseline.
**Third step:**
Monitor the performance of the constructed pipeline from the previous
step across different time budgets (number of iterations) and report the least time
budget that you are able to outperform the baseline.
**Fourth step:**
Determine whether the difference in performance between the constructed pipeline
and the baseline is statistically significant.
